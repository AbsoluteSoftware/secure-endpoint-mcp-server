The following table lists each login URL and the corresponding API access URL:</p>\n<table style=\"width: 100%;margin-left: 0;margin-right: auto;\">\n    <col />\n    <col />\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Login URL</th>\n            <th>API access URL</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>https://cc.absolute.com </td>\n            <td>https://api.absolute.com/jws/validate</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>https://cc.us.absolute.com</td>\n            <td>https://api.us.absolute.com/jws/validate</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td>https://cc.eu2.absolute.com</td>\n            <td>https://api.eu2.absolute.com/jws/validate</td>\n        </tr>\n\t\t <tr>\n            <td>https://cc.fr1.absolutegov.com</td>\n            <td>https://api.fr1.absolutegov.com/jws/validate</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\n<p>There are two prerequisites for the Absolute API:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>The developer must have a user created in the Secure Endpoint Console that is assigned an Absolute user role. The role can be a default user role, or a custom user role defined by your organization.</li>\n    <li>The user must have at least one API token associated with it in the Secure Endpoint Console. See <a href=\"#section/Getting-started:-Create-your-credentials/Create-your-API-token\">Create your API token</a> for more information on creating an API token.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"note\">Depending on the permissions associated with your API token and the <a href=\"https://www.absolute.com/platform/compare-absolute-products/\" target=\"_blank\">Absolute product licenses</a> associated with your account, some endpoints may not be available to you.</p></span>\n\n## Requests\n\n<span class='doc-key' jsonkey='(file:doc.introduction.requests.html)'><p>API requests contain three types of parameters: <a href=\"#pathParameters\">path</a>, <a href=\"#queryParameters\">query</a>, and <a href=\"#requestParameters\">request body schema</a> parameters.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pathParameters\">Path parameters</h3>\n<p>Path parameters are included in the endpoint URI and are surrounded with curly braces ({}). If the endpoint contains a path parameter, the path parameter is described for the endpoint, including the data type. All path parameters are required parameters.</p>\n<div class=\"example\">\n    <p>For <code><a href=\"#operation/get-run-script-actions-by-request-uid\">POST v3/actions/reach/get-actions/{requestUid}</a></code>, <code>{requestUid}</code> is the path parameter.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"queryParameters\">Query parameters</h3>\n<p>Query parameters are used for <a href=\"#section/Sorting\">sorting</a>, <a href=\"#section/Filtering\">filtering</a>, <a href=\"#section/Selecting\">selecting</a>, and <a href=\"#section/Pagination\">pagination</a> of the API results. A query parameter is a key-value pair. The parameter value must be URL encoded. Multiple query parameters can be used by separating key-value pairs by an ampersand (&amp;). Query parameters use the following format:</p>\n<p><code>\"paramName1={encodedParamValue1}&amp;paramName2={encodedParamValue2}\"</code></p>\n<p>where <code>paramName<em>n</em></code> is the key for query parameter <em>n</em> and <code>{encodedParamValue<em>n</em>}</code> is the URL encoded value assigned to the query parameter <em>n</em>.</p>\n<p>For nested parameters, use dot notation for <code>paramName<em>n</em></code>. The top level object is followed by a period (.), which is then followed by the parameter.</p>\n<div class=\"example\">\n    <p>For the device status type in the <code><a href=\"#operation/get-devices\">GET /v3/reporting/devices</a></code> resource, the top level object is <code>deviceStatus</code> and the parameter is <code>type</code>. The value for the <code>paramName<em>n</em></code> query parameter is:</p>\n    <pre class=\"codeblock\">deviceStatus.type</pre>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"requestParameters\">Request body schema parameters</h3>\n<p>The request body schema for each endpoint defines the required and optional parameters for each endpoint. These parameters are included in the payload and the payload is used to as part of the <a href=\"#section/Authentication/JWS\">authentication</a> for the request.</p>\n<p>Empty payloads, such as those found in <code>GET</code> requests, should be set to an empty JSON object:</p>\n<div class=\"example\">\n    <pre class=\"codeblock\">{}</pre>\n</div>\n<p>Non-empty payloads need to be wrapped in a data tag:</p>\n<div class=\"example\">\n    <p>The request body:</p>\n    <pre class=\"codeblock\">{\n    \"deviceUids\": [\n        \"56be8d1f-2eb8-4e9b-bbd6-1aab032abcde\",\n        \"56be8d1f-2eb8-4e9b-bbd6-2bbc032bcdef\"\n    ]\n}</pre>\n    <p>The request body is then wrapped with a <code>data</code> key:</p>\n    <pre class=\"codeblock\">{\n    \"data\": {\n        \"deviceUids\": [\n            \"56be8d1f-2eb8-4e9b-bbd6-1aab032abcde\",\n            \"56be8d1f-2eb8-4e9b-bbd6-2bbc032bcdef\"\n        ]\n    }\n}</pre>\n</div></span>\n\n## Responses\n\n<span class='doc-key' jsonkey='(file:doc.introduction.responses.html)'><p>The API call can have either a successful or failure response.</p>\n<h3>Successful response</h3>\n<p>The response body for a successful API call includes two sections, <code>data</code> and <code>metadata</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>data</code> section is the actual results returned from the resource. Each endpoint lists all of the possible parameters that may be returned in the <code>data</code> section. If a parameter has a null value, the parameter isn't returned in the response.</p>\n<p>The <code>metadata</code> section includes the pagination string to get the next page of results. For more information, see the <b>Pagination</b> tab in <a href=\"#queryParameters\"><strong>Query parameters</strong></a>.</p>\n<h3>Failure response</h3>\n<p>Failed responses are made up of three sections, <code>code</code>, <code>message</code>, and <code>details</code>. The <code>code</code> and the <code>message</code> are the general reasons for the failure. If detailed error information is available, you can expand the <code>details</code> section to find an array of objects. Each object contains information on why the request was invalid, and if applicable, which field caused the error.</p></span>\n\n# Authentication\n\n<span class='doc-key' jsonkey='(file:doc.authentication.txt)'><p>All API requests must be authenticated. The Absolute API uses JSON Web Signature (JWS) cryptography to authenticate API requests. As part of the request, you need to generate an <a href=\"#section/Authentication/API-tokens\">API token</a> in the Secure Endpoint Console. Information from the token is used as part of JWS authentication.</p>\n<p>API requests use either asymmetric or symmetric encryption.</p>\n<h3 id=\"authAsymmetricEncryption\">Asymmetric encryption</h3>\n<p>Asymmetric encryption uses a key pair consisting of a public key and a private key. Only the public key is shared between parties. For this type of token, you <a href=\"#Step1\">generate a public and private key pair</a> outside of the Secure Endpoint Console, and <a href=\"#Step2\">upload the public key</a> to the Secure Endpoint Console. A token ID is created when you upload the public key, the token ID becomes part of the JOSE header. The private key is used for encryption and you are the only party that has access to the private key.</p>\n<h3 id=\"authSymmetricEncryption\">Symmetric encryption</h3>\n<p>Symmetric encryption uses a key that is shared between parties. For symmetric encryption, you <a href=\"#Step2\">generate a token ID with a secret key</a> directly in the Secure Endpoint Console. The secret key is the shared key.</p>\n<p>There are many libraries available for JWS authentication, such as the libraries listed by <a href=\"https://jwt.io/libraries\" target=\"_blank\">JWT.io</a>. You can also work from <a href=\"#section/Getting-started:-Create-your-request\">Getting started: Create your request</a>.</p></span>\n\n## JSON Web Signature construction\n\n<span class='doc-key' jsonkey='(file:doc.authentication.jws.html)'><p>JSON Web Signature (JWS) consists of three parts concatenated with a period (.).

When you create your API token in the console, you are provided with the token ID that is used as part of the request authentication.</p>\n<p>For more information, see <em>Creating API tokens</em> in the online help.</p>\n<p>By default, the token has the same permissions as your assigned user role. This means that if you have access to certain functionality in the Secure Endpoint Console, the token you create has equivalent access in the API. If your user account is assigned to a single device group when the token is created, the token is assigned that device group. If your user account's device group assignment changes in the future, the token isn't updated. The token is still assigned to the original device group.</p>\n<h3>API token permissions</h3>\n<p>When you create the token, you can modify the token's permissions. You can't assign permissions to a token that your user role doesn't have, but you can remove permissions. For added security, limit the API token to the minimum permissions required for its intended use. Once the token is created, the permissions for the token can't be changed.</p>\n<p>If the user role associated with the token is assigned dual approval limits, devices in the request created using the API token are included in the device total. Requests created using the API that exceed the daily threshold also require approval.</p>\n<p>If the user account associated with the token is suspended or deleted, the token is no longer valid. If the user is deleted, the API token is also deleted.</p>\n<h3>Permission requirements</h3>\n<p>To use an endpoint, the token generally requires the same feature permissions that your user role requires to perform the action in the console, with some differences. For specific information about the permission (or permissions) required to use each endpoint, refer to the <em>Permissions</em> section in the overview for each resource.</p>\n<h3>API token expiry</h3>\n<p>Tokens have an expiry date. The expiry date can be up to one year from the day the token is created. You can continue to use the token until 23:59:59 UTC on the day the token expires. Before a token expires, you can edit the expiry date in the Secure Endpoint Console.

Each one starts with the parameter name, and most of them end in a suffix that indicates the type of match. For example, to filter the results using agent status, the query parameter or <code>filter</code> field would start with <code>agentStatus</code>. To match a value, use the parameter name by itself, <code>agentStatus</code>. To include results that don't match a value, use the parameter name followed by <i>Not</i>, <code>agentStatusNot</code>. The possible suffixes are:</p>\n<div class=\"threeColumns\">\n    <ul>\n        <li>AnyOf</li>\n        <li>Contains</li>\n        <li>Empty</li>\n        <li>EndsWith</li>\n        <li>From</li>\n        <li>FromInclusive</li>\n        <li>Not</li>\n        <li>NotContains</li>\n        <li>NotEndsWith</li>\n        <li>NotStartsWith</li>\n        <li>StartsWith</li>\n        <li>To</li>\n        <li>ToInclusive</li>\n    </ul>\n</div>\n<p>Not every parameter that is returned in the response can be used to filter the results. To determine if you can filter on a parameter, you need to search the list of query parameters when using <a href=\"#section/Filtering/Simple-filtering\">simple filtering</a> or the list of <code>filter</code> fields when using <a href=\"#section/Filtering/Advanced-filtering\">advanced filtering</a>. If they apply to the endpoint, the <code>sortBy</code>, <code>select</code>, <code>nextPage</code>, and <code>pageSize</code> parameters are listed first in the <strong>Query Parameters</strong> section. For simple filtering, all other parameters that you can use to filter the results are listed in alphabetical order. For advanced filtering, the fields that can be used in the <code>filter</code> query parameter are listed in alphabetical order.</p>\n<p>Most endpoints use simple filtering. To see if you can filter the results for a specific parameters, go to the <strong>Query Parameters</strong> section for the endpoint. If the query parameters are hidden, like in <code><a href='#tag/Custom-Data/operation/get-cdc-datapoints'>GET configurations/custom-data-collector/datapoints</a></code>, expand the list.</p>\n<p id=\"groupParameters\">For the <code><a href='#operation/get-devices'>GET /reporting/devices</a></code> and <code><a href='#operation/get-applications'>GET /reporting/applications</a></code> endpoints, there are a large number of parameters. The parameters for selecting, sorting, and pagination are grouped together. To view them, expand the group. The parameters used for filtering are also grouped together. Within the filtering group, the filtering parameters are also grouped by the fields available for filtering. These groups are listed in alphabetical order.</p><div class=\"example\">\n    <p>You want to filter the results of <code><a href='#operation/get-devices'>GET /reporting/devices</a></code>  based on <code>deviceName</code>.
